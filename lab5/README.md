### Start with ChatGPT
- I entered this prompt into ChatGPT:

- ChatGPT returned 3 files that do the work. I want something different: put an icon inside each widget. When we switch one widget with another, the icon moves along to show the identity of each widget.
- After that, tailor the CSS style to my liking.
