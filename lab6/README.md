### Start with ChatGPT
- I entered this prompt into ChatGPT:
Build a real time chat application using Web Socket
Requirement:
- Create a simple chat UI, with the input message section, submit and the messages section
- Use WebSocket to allow real time chat between clients
- Highlight and show the message from each client in the common messages section
- Use Node.js for backend implementation
About the code:
- Use a Socket.io server for Node.js
- Use CSS to give style to each kind of message
- Handle the event (onopen, onmessage, onclose, onerror) reasonably
